## Welcome   
# Software Engineer  
I'm a software engineer and start up enthusiast, passionate about products that provide meaningful value.  
I have ~7 years of experience with full stack - **back end** heavy roles, overseeing application architecture.  
As the great Johan Cruyff used to say "Playing football is very simple, but playing simple football is the hardest thing there is",  
exactly the same can be applied to code and architecture, so a good engineer is there to provide simplicity.  

I'm mostly skilled with Java (Spring Boot, Quarkus) & React, but I've also worked with other languages like Go & Python.  

**Personal Projects**  
Below is a brief description of my personal projects to help you navigate my repositories more easily.  

[Asset Retriever](https://github.com/kyrillosyannis/go-asset-retriever)  
A REST API written in Go, with Gin & GORM.  
It was completed as a side project in one week, having minimal prior experience with the language, showing that good engineers should have no problem switching language/framework.  

[Movie API](https://github.com/kyrillosyannis/movies-app)  
A REST API in Java, showcasing how I approach code architecture in a single service, JWT auth, unit testing, DB migrations with Flyway and Docker containerization  
with its subsequent [client app](https://github.com/kyrillosyannis/movies-app-client)  


[Civ App](https://github.com/kyrillosyannis/civ-app)  
MVP for a petition/ticketing platform for civilians that has been selved.
